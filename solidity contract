This Solidity contract, MyToken, implements a basic token system with minting and burning functionalities. Here's a breakdown of the contract:

Public Variables:

tokenName: A string representing the name of the token ("META").
tokenAbbrv: A string representing the token's abbreviation ("MTA").
totalSupply: A uint representing the total number of tokens in circulation, initially set to 0.
Mapping:

balances: A mapping that associates addresses with their token balances.
Mint Function:

The mint function allows increasing the totalSupply of the token and adding tokens to a specific address's balance.
The function takes an _address (recipient) and _value (number of tokens to mint) as arguments, adding the _value to both totalSupply and the recipient's balance.
Burn Function:

The burn function allows reducing the totalSupply and a specific address's balance.
It checks that the _address has enough tokens to burn. If so, it subtracts the specified _value from both the addressâ€™s balance and the totalSupply.
If the balance is insufficient, the transaction is reverted with an error message.
This is a simple implementation of a token, without more advanced features like transfer functions, allowances, or ownership control.
