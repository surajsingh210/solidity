The objective of this smart contract, MyToken, is to create a simple token system on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows the following:

Minting New Tokens: The contract owner or any designated party can create new tokens and assign them to specific addresses, increasing both the total supply of tokens and the recipient's balance.

Burning Tokens: Token holders can destroy a certain amount of their tokens, reducing their balance as well as the total supply of tokens.

The contract does not include transfer mechanisms, so its focus is primarily on managing token creation (minting) and destruction (burning) rather than trading or transferring between users. It's a foundational framework for managing a token's supply and could be expanded with more features like transfers or access controls.
